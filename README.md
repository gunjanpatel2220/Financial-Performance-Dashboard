‚öôÔ∏è How I Built It
Data Collection & Preparation

Imported a structured CSV file containing monthly financial data from 2023 to 2024.

Data includes categories like Revenue, COGS, Profit, Assets, Liabilities, Equity, and more.

Data Modeling

Cleaned and shaped the data using Power BI Power Query Editor.

Defined relationships between tables (if more than one CSV or Excel sheet used).

Created measures using DAX for KPIs like:

Gross Profit = Revenue - COGS

Net Profit = Gross Profit - Operating Expenses

Gross Profit Margin = Gross Profit / Revenue

Net Profit Margin = Net Profit / Revenue

Dashboard Design

Built an interactive dashboard with slicers for:

Year

Month

Entity (if multi-department)

Included KPIs with actual vs budget % changes.

Used trend visuals to compare MTD/YTD against benchmarks.

Export & Reporting

Exported the dashboard as a PDF report (attached in the repo).

Captured visuals and added them in the Images folder for a quick view.

üí° Key Insights
Net Profit exceeded budget by 263.16%.
